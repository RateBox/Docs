- Upgraded redis-py and fixed xpending_range bug

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned
- **Consumer group management is critical**: Always handle pending/failed messages and test with multiple workers.
- **UUID v7 brings real performance gains**: Enables time-ordered inserts and efficient partitioning.
- **Monitoring must be real-time**: Redis Exporter + Prometheus + Grafana is essential for production.
- **Docker health checks save debugging time**: Always add health checks for every container.
- **Documentation is key**: Integration guides and changelogs accelerate onboarding and debugging.
- **Backup/restore should be tested, not just scripted**: Run quarterly restore drills.
